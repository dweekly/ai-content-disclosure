- ~~**File WICG Proposals issue**~~ — Done:
  [WICG/proposals#261](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/261)

- ~~**Comment on WHATWG HTML #9479**~~ — Done: commented linking to the
  explainer as the element-level solution requested by thread participants.

- ~~**Request browser standards positions**~~ — Done:
  - [ChromeStatus](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5078123181899776)
  - [mozilla/standards-positions#1344](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1344)
  - [WebKit/standards-positions#605](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/605)

- **Engage W3C AI & the Web Community Group** — Present the proposal to the
  [W3C AI & the Web CG](https://www.w3.org/community/ai-web/) for alignment
  with their recommendations on content labeling.

- ~~**File Schema.org proposal**~~ — Done: proposed `aiDisclosure` property
  on `CreativeWork` as a comment on
  [schemaorg/schemaorg#3391](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3391).

- **Connect with IPTC** — Verify vocabulary alignment with IPTC Digital
  Source Type maintainers. Ensure the mapping table is accurate and
  future-compatible.

- **Connect with C2PA working group** — Discuss how HTML-level disclosure
  could be cryptographically bound to C2PA manifests for verified provenance.

- **Request W3C TAG review** — Once WICG incubation is underway, request a
  [TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues) for
  architectural feedback.

- **Build a polyfill / demo** — Create a small JavaScript library and browser
  extension that surfaces `ai-disclosure` attributes visually, demonstrating
  the user experience without browser-native support.

- **Engage regulatory stakeholders** — Position this standard as a technical
  mechanism for EU AI Act Article 50 compliance. Connect with the EU Code of
  Practice on AI-Generated Content working group.
