- **Connect with IPTC** — Verify vocabulary alignment with IPTC Digital
  Source Type maintainers. Ensure the mapping table is accurate and
  future-compatible.

- **Connect with C2PA working group** — Discuss how HTML-level disclosure
  could be cryptographically bound to C2PA manifests for verified provenance.

- **Request W3C TAG review** — Once WICG incubation is underway, request a
  [TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues) for
  architectural feedback.

- **Build a polyfill / demo** — Create a small JavaScript library and browser
  extension that surfaces `ai-disclosure` attributes visually, demonstrating
  the user experience without browser-native support.

- **Engage regulatory stakeholders** — Position this standard as a technical
  mechanism for EU AI Act Article 50 compliance. Connect with the EU Code of
  Practice on AI-Generated Content working group.
