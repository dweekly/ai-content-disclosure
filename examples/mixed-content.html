      <h2>Exclusive: City Budget Shortfall Traced to Misclassified Funds</h2>
      <p class="byline">By Jane Doe, Investigative Reporter &middot;
        January 25, 2026</p>

      <p>A six-month investigation by The Daily Record has uncovered a
      $4.2 million discrepancy in the city's infrastructure fund.
      Financial records obtained through public records requests reveal
      that maintenance expenditures were systematically misclassified as
      capital improvements, inflating the apparent value of the city's
      asset portfolio.</p>

      <p>"The numbers simply don't add up," said Maria Chen, a forensic
      accountant retained by The Daily Record to review the documents.
      "You have invoices for pothole repairs booked as road construction.
      That's not an accounting error — that's a pattern."</p>

      <p>City officials declined to comment on specific transactions but
      issued a statement saying the administration "is committed to fiscal
      transparency and welcomes any review of its accounting practices."</p>
