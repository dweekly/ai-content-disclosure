      <h2>How Local Farms Are Adapting to Climate Change</h2>
      <p class="byline">By Sarah Park &middot; January 20, 2026</p>

      <p>In the sun-scorched fields east of the valley, third-generation
      farmer Tom Reyes is trying something his grandfather never imagined:
      growing high-altitude coffee varieties at sea level.</p>

      <p>"The frost dates have shifted three weeks in my lifetime," Reyes
      said, walking between rows of experimental Gesha plants. "We either
      adapt or we sell the land."</p>

      <p>According to county agricultural data, average growing-season
      temperatures in the region have risen 2.1°F since 1990. The shift
      has made traditional crops less viable while opening possibilities
      for subtropical varieties previously confined to greenhouse
      cultivation.</p>
