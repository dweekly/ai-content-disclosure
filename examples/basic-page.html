    <p>The bamboo grove at Arashiyama felt otherworldly at dawn. Thin shafts
    of light cut through the towering stalks, and the only sound was the
    creak of bamboo swaying in the wind.</p>

    <p>I had arrived in Kyoto the previous evening, stepping off the
    Shinkansen into a city that seemed to exist in two centuries at once.
    Glass-fronted convenience stores sat beneath wooden machiya townhouses,
    their latticed facades unchanged for generations.</p>

    <p>The highlight was Fushimi Inari. Thousands of vermillion torii gates
    march up Mount Inari in a seemingly endless corridor. At the summit,
    the city spread below in a grid of grey and green, and I understood why
    pilgrims had been climbing this path for twelve centuries.</p>
